# PredicMem23

This project contains the source code used in the paper: "Competitive Cost-effective Memory Access Predictor through Short-Term Online SVM
and Dynamic Vocabularies", SÃ¡nchez-Cuevas et al., 2024, currently in revision for Future Generation Computer Systems.

The developed software allows the user to implement and embed any address prediction model for memory access traces, collected by Intel Pin while instrumenting a program.

In the following days, a major detailed refactorization and documentation will be performed. Stay tuned!
