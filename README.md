# PredicMem23

This project contains the source code used in the paper: "Competitive Cost-effective Memory Access Predictor through Short-Term Online SVM and Dynamic Vocabularies", SÃ¡nchez-Cuevas et al., Future Generation Computer Systems, Volume 164, 2025, 107592,ISSN 0167-739X, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2024.107592. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X24005569).

The developed software allows the user to implement and embed any address prediction model for memory access traces, collected by Intel Pin while instrumenting a program.

The full code documentation can be consulted in https://hematies.github.io/PredicMem23/. In the near future, further refactorization and documentation will be performed, plus new versions for better adaptability to new models are expected. Stay tuned!
